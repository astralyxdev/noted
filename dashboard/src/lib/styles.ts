/**
 * The kit's global style contract.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Rule: prefer `secondary` over `outline`.
 *
 * Where a component offers both, reach for the tinted `secondary` treatment. An
 * outline draws a line around everything it touches; a screen full of them
 * turns into a grid of boxes with no hierarchy, and the borders start competing
 * with the ones that carry real structure — a card edge, a table rule, a
 * divider. A tint separates without adding another line.
 *
 * The same applies to fields: `variant="secondary"` (filled) rather than the
 * bordered default. `outline` stays in the API for the case it is actually
 * right — a control sitting on an already-tinted surface, where a second fill
 * would compete instead of separate.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Every component composes these fragments instead of spelling out its own
 * focus ring, radius or control height — change a line here and the whole kit
 * follows. Anything colour- or radius-shaped resolves to a CSS variable
 * declared in `index.css`, so themes stay in one place too.
